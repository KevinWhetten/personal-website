      <h2>American Fork High School</h2>
      <h3>Class of 2012</h3>
      <p>I first took a programming course during my sophomore year. I learned C++ first, then took AP Computer Science
        learning Java during my junior year. I earned a 4 (out of 5) on the AP Computer Science exam.</p>
      <p>During my senior year at AFHS, I developed chronic depression, which caused my grades to suffer. With a
        combination of support from friends, understanding teachers, and luck, I was able to graduate on time despite my
        poor mental health. Shortly after high school, I took a break to earn some money and go to therapy, which really
        helped.</p>

      <h2>Snow College</h2>
      <h3>2014 - 2015</h3>
      <p>After graduating from high school, I worked to save up some money before attending Snow College. I took an
        introduction to programming course there, and helped solidify my skills in C++. My teacher was amazing, and I
        learned so much while I was there. I also discovered a love of Astronomy, and continued my music career as a
        member of the Snow College Symphony Orchestra.</p>

      <h2>Utah Valley University</h2>
      <h3>2016 - 2018</h3>
      <p>After I left Snow College, I took a break before retuning to school at Utah Valley University. My schoolwork
        there included some of my favorite classes including Discrete Math, Web Development, and C# Development.
        However, I still struggled with depression, which made traditional schooling very difficult. So, I
        decided to transfer to an online university.</p>

      <h2>Western Governors University</h2>
      <h3>Class of 2021</h3>
      <p>So, during the summer, I started schoolwork at Western Governors University. The online structure gave me the
        freedom to work at my own pace, which was just what I needed. I took a variety of courses, which included
        development in Java and Python, as well as an in-depth class about SQL.</p>
      <p>I was also able to display my skills by developing a capstone project for Emmersion. Unfortunately, due to
        company policy, I no longer have access to the code, but you can see a detailed analysis <a

          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I created a website using C#, Angular, and SqlServer. It
        gathers data from the Microsoft Azure and Kanbanize APIs, and calculates and displays a variety of Key
        Performance Indicators for the development team at Emmersion. Upon the completion of the project, I finally
        graduated in January 2021 with a <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> degree in <strong>Computer
          Science</strong>.</p>
